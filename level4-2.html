I want to be the waves when they dance<br>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;alone, the midnight tone, I want to be your back bone. 
        I want to be<br></em>&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <strong>your perfect scent, your missed rent, those days you feel you need to repent.<br>

I want to be your dark brown hair, the place back when we didn't care, the memories<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;only we share. 
I want you in all the ways I can say. 
I'll want you forever and always each and every day.</strong>
           <h1>I never knew you could know me so much better
I ignored all the great weather 
               the darkest cloud hung over</h1><h2> me and I let my head fall on the air
my hair was still wet but not the day that we met

        Was it someone</h2><h3> like you who did it to be so kind
Leaves on the grass with words drawn out
You admired me and</h3><h4>wanted to hold my hand
I let the curtains fly in
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by

        Wearing</h4><h5> the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans
Dropping love on my sleeve
        Too many wishes</h5> that I hope they’re not an omen
        I never knew a heart could beat for me.
